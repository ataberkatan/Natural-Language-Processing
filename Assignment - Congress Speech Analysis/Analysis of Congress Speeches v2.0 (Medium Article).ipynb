    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "To qualitatively discuss the similarity between the two senators' speeches some background on who they are is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Moseley-Braun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Moseley_Braun) was *the first African-American woman* elected to the U.S. Senate, the first African-American U.S. Senator from the **Democratic Party**, *the first woman to defeat an incumbent U.S. Senator in an election*, and the first female U.S. Senator from Illinois.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Harry Mason Reid Jr.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reid) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States senator from Nevada from 1987 to 2017. He *led the Senate **Democratic** Caucus from 2005 to 2017* and was *the Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both senators were from the same party, the dissimilarity between them should most likely to be rooted in their backgrounds and identities they stand for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moseley-Braun had been the first to set many milestones while Reid's election and re-ellection has arguably been in smoother conditions. Moseley-Braun is an African-American woman to be the first female U.S. Senator in her state while Reid is from an already well represented identity group - white and male.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity being above 50% might be due to the fact that they are from the same party but the present difference is, at least superficially, because they are vastly different character and from very different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better grounded analysis, we can look at the similarity measures of multiple pairs of senator speeches from the same and different parties and employ a comparative perspective. This approach can reveal patterns more clearly as to what makes two speeches similar and what having similar speeches tells us about the characteristics of the senators in comparison. Furthermore, different methods of vectorizing speeches and different measures of similarity might give qualitatively different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we found here a similarity of 65%. A good reference point would be the average level of similarity between senators of the two different parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What about when we use a different vectorizer and look at different n-gram ranges?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation 1**: We see that for every n-gram range, Bag-of-Words gives a higher cosine similarity. This is because TF-IDF is more restrictive. While Bag-of-Words simply records how many times each word is used in both texts, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) gives a measure of how often word i (or n-gram i) appeared in text j, penalized by the number of texts also containing word i. In other words, the weight of a word is proportional to its frequency in the document (term frequency) and inversely proportional to its frequency across the corpus (inverse document frequency). Words that are common across the corpus (i.e., appear in many documents) receive a lower weight, while words that are rare in the corpus receive a higher weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation 2**: We look n-grams alone and cumulatively i.e., 1, 2 and 3-grams together for (1,3) n-gram range. If we take the first case, looking at 2-grams or 3-grams alone, we see for both vectorizers the cosine similarities strictly decrease as we look at larger grams. In the cumulative case, we see again cosine similarities decreasing. However, the decrease in this case is slower because it is easier to get a high measure of cosine similarity when looking at 1-grams than 2-grams and easier when looking at 2-grams than 3-grams. Looking at a range of 1 to 3 grams rather than just 3 grams results in higher cosine similarity due to the above logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What about a different similarity measure?\n",
    "We also look at *Manhattan Distance* measures between text vectors. Manhattan Distance is the distance between two vectors as the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of the two vectors. It is also known as L1 distance. A lower value indicates greater similarity. See [Taxicab Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is a distance measure, the lower the value, the more similar the two vectors."
